# Multivariable regression

Create a publication-ready multivariable regression table using either
gt or flextable, without a gtsummary dependency.

## Usage

``` r
multi_reg(
  data,
  outcome,
  exposures,
  adjust_for = NULL,
  interaction = NULL,
  approach = "logit",
  format = c("gt", "flextable"),
  theme = c("minimal")
)
```

## Arguments

- data:

  A `data.frame` containing the variables of interest.

- outcome:

  Character scalar; name of the outcome variable.

- exposures:

  Character vector; exposure variable(s) to report. If
  `adjust_for = NULL`, all exposures are included in a single
  multivariable model. If `adjust_for` is supplied, one adjusted model
  is fitted per exposure and only exposure-specific adjusted estimate(s)
  are displayed.

- adjust_for:

  Optional character vector of adjustment variables. Must not overlap
  with `exposures`.

- interaction:

  Optional character scalar specifying one interaction term using
  standard formula syntax, e.g. `"bmi*sex"`. When used with
  `adjust_for`, only a single exposure should be supplied.

- approach:

  Character scalar specifying the regression approach. One of `"logit"`,
  `"logbinomial"`, `"poisson"`, `"linear"`, `"robpoisson"`, or
  `"negbin"`.

- format:

  Output table format; one of `"gt"` (default) or `"flextable"`.

- theme:

  Table styling preset (e.g. `"minimal"`, `"striped"`, `"clinical"`,
  `"shaded"`, `"jama"`) or a character vector of primitives such as
  `c("plain","zebra","lines","labels_bold","compact","header_shaded")`.

## Value

A list of class `c("gtregression","multi_reg", ...)` with elements:

- table:

  A `gt_tbl` (if `format="gt"`) or `flextable` (if
  `format="flextable"`).

- table_body:

  A data frame of adjusted estimates and confidence intervals for each
  exposure and level.

- table_display:

  A data frame used for rendering the final table, including header and
  level rows.

- models:

  A list of fitted model(s).

- model_summaries:

  [`summary()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/summary.html) output for the
  fitted model(s).

- reg_check:

  Regression diagnostics for linear models; otherwise a message.

- approach:

  The regression approach used.

- format:

  The output format used.

- source:

  Function identifier (`"multi_reg"`).

- adjusted_mode:

  Whether one adjusted model per exposure was fitted.

- adjust_for:

  Adjustment variables supplied by the user, if any.

- exposures:

  Exposure variables supplied by the user.

- interaction:

  Interaction term supplied by the user, if any.

## Details

In default mode (`adjust_for = NULL`), all exposures are included in a
single multivariable model. In adjusted mode, one model is fitted per
exposure, adjusting for the variables specified in `adjust_for`.

Interaction terms specified via `interaction` are included in the model
using standard formula expansion (e.g. `bmi*sex`). Interaction effects
are displayed as additional rows beneath the corresponding exposure.
