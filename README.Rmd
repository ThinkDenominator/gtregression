# gtregression

`gtregression` is an R package that simplifies regression modeling and generates publication-ready tables using the `gtsummary` ecosystem. It supports a variety of regression approaches with built-in tools for model diagnostics, selection, and confounder identification—all designed to provide beginner and intermediate R users with clean, interpretable output.

This package was created with the aim of empowering R users in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) by offering a simpler and more accessible coding experience. We sincerely thank the authors and contributors of foundational R packages such as `gtsummary`, `MASS`, `RISKS`, `dplyr`, and others—without whom this project would not have been possible.

## Vision

At its core, `gtregression` is more than just a statistical tool—it is a commitment to open access, simplicity, and inclusivity in health data science. Our team is driven by the vision of empowering researchers, students, and public health professionals in LMICs through user-friendly, well-documented tools that minimize coding burden and maximize interpretability.

We strongly believe in the democratization of data science, and aim to promote the use of open-source resources for impactful and equitable research across the globe.

## Features

- Supports multiple regression types:  
  Logistic (logit)  
  Log-binomial  
  Poisson / Robust Poisson  
  Negative Binomial  
  Linear Regression

- Univariable and multivariable regression  
- Confounder identification using crude, adjusted, and stratified estimates  
- Stepwise model selection with AIC/BIC/adjusted R²  
- Stratified regression functions  
- Integration with `gtsummary` for formatted tables  
- Built-in healthcare datasets for training: `PimaIndiansDiabetes2`, `birthwt`, `epil`

## Installation

```r
# Install from GitHub (requires devtools)
devtools::install_github("drrubesh/gtregression")
```

```r
## Quick Start
library(gtregression)

# Logistic regression example
data(PimaIndiansDiabetes2)
multi_reg(
  data = PimaIndiansDiabetes2,
  outcome = "diabetes",
  exposures = c("age", "mass", "glucose"),
  approach = "logit"
)
```

```r
# Negative binomial regression example
data(epil)
multi_reg_nbin(
  data = epil,
  outcome = "y",
  exposures = c("trt", "base", "age")
)
```
