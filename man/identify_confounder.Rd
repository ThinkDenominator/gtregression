\title{Identify Confounder Using Change-in-Estimate Method}
\usage{
identify_confounder(
  data,
  outcome,
  exposure,
  potential_confounder,
  approach = "logit",
  threshold = 10
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame.}

\item{outcome}{The name of the outcome variable (binary, count, or continuous depending on approach).}

\item{exposure}{The name of the exposure variable.}

\item{potential_confounder}{One or more covariates to test as potential confounders.}

\item{approach}{Regression approach: one of "logit", "log-binomial", "poisson", "negbin", "linear", "robpoisson"}

\item{threshold}{Numeric value specifying the percentage change in effect size considered meaningful for confounding (default is 10).}
}
\value{
A tibble or list containing crude and adjusted estimates, percent change,
and an indicator of confounding.
}
\description{
Estimates the crude and adjusted effect of an exposure on an outcome,
then checks for confounding using the change-in-estimate method.
Supports multiple regression approaches including logit, log-binomial,
Poisson, negative binomial, robust Poisson, and linear regression.
