\title{Identify Confounders Using the Change-in-Estimate Method}
\usage{
identify_confounder(
  data,
  outcome,
  exposure,
  potential_confounder,
  approach = "logit",
  threshold = 10
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the variables.}

\item{outcome}{The name of the outcome variable (binary, count, or continuous, depending on approach).}

\item{exposure}{The name of the main exposure variable to test.}

\item{potential_confounder}{A character vector of one or more variables to test as potential confounders.}

\item{approach}{The regression modeling approach. One of:
\code{"logit"} (logistic), \code{"log-binomial"}, \code{"poisson"},
\code{"negbin"} (negative binomial), \code{"robpoisson"}, or \code{"linear"}.}

\item{threshold}{A numeric value specifying the percent change in the estimate (default is 10).
If the absolute percent change from the crude to adjusted estimate exceeds this threshold,
the variable is flagged as a confounder.}
}
\value{
A `tibble` summarizing:
\itemize{
  \item Crude effect estimate (e.g., OR, RR, IRR, Beta)
  \item Adjusted effect estimate (after including each potential confounder)
  \item Percent change in estimate
  \item Confounder flag (TRUE/FALSE)
}
}
\description{
This function evaluates whether one or more variables are confounders of the relationship between
an exposure and outcome by comparing crude and adjusted effect estimates.
A variable is considered a confounder if inclusion in the model changes the effect size
by more than a specified threshold (default: 10%).
}
\details{
Supports multiple regression approaches including logistic, log-binomial,
Poisson, negative binomial, robust Poisson, and linear regression.
