## Introduction

The `gtregression` package provides a user-friendly interface for generating publication-ready regression tables, performing model diagnostics, visualizing results, and identifying confounders. It is especially designed for beginner analysts, epidemiologists, and public health professionals—particularly those in low- and middle-income country (LMIC) settings—to promote the use of open-access tools in data analytics. This vignette demonstrates how to use key functions of the package.

## Design Principles

The development of `gtregression` was driven by the need to make R more approachable 
for those who find it intimidating or overly technical. For many public health professionals, researchers, and students in LMICs, regression modeling in R can feel fragmented and difficult to interpret.

We intentionally rely on existing, well-tested packages — not because we can’t code them ourselves, but because it’s better for users to stand on stable ground. Our job is to smooth the path by:

- Wrapping complexity into clear function calls
- Minimising required parameters through smart defaults
- Offering layered outputs: readable summary + full technical object
- Reducing time-to-insight and time-to-publish

By justifying our dependencies as tools that serve the user, we maintain transparency 
while staying focused on enhancing their experience.


``` r
library(gtregression)
library(dplyr)
```

## Load Example Data

We use the `PimaIndiansDiabetes2` dataset:

``` r
data("PimaIndiansDiabetes2", package = "gtregression")

pima_data <- PimaIndiansDiabetes2 %>%
  mutate(diabetes = ifelse(diabetes == "pos", 1, 0)) %>%
  mutate(
    bmi = case_when(mass < 25 ~ "Normal",
                    mass >= 25 & mass < 30 ~ "Overweight",
                    mass >= 30 ~ "Obese"),
    bmi = factor(bmi, levels = c("Normal", "Overweight", "Obese")),
    age_cat = case_when(age < 30 ~ "Young",
                        age >= 30 & age < 50 ~ "Middle-aged",
                        age >= 50 ~ "Older"),
    age_cat = factor(age_cat, levels = c("Young", "Middle-aged", "Older"))
  )
```

## Univariate and Multivariable Regression
```r
uni_tbl <- uni_reg(
  data = pima_data,
  outcome = "diabetes",
  exposures = c("bmi", "age_cat"),
  approach = "logit"
)

uni_tbl

multi_tbl <- multi_reg(
  data = pima_data,
  outcome = "diabetes",
  exposures = c("bmi", "age_cat"),
  approach = "logit"
)

multi_tbl
```
## Stratified Regression
```r
stratified_uni <- stratified_uni_reg(
  data = pima_data,
  outcome = "diabetes",
  exposures = c("bmi"),
  stratifier = "age_cat",
  approach = "logit"
)
stratified_uni

stratified_multi <- stratified_multi_reg(
  data = pima_data,
  outcome = "diabetes",
  exposures = c("bmi"),
  stratifier = "age_cat",
  approach = "logit"
)

stratified_multi
```

## Identifying Confounders
```r
identify_confounder(
  data = pima_data,
  outcome = "diabetes",
  exposure = "bmi",
  potential_confounder = "age_cat",
  approach = "logit"
)
```
## Model Diagnostics
```r
check_convergence(
  data = pima_data,
  outcome = "diabetes",
  exposures = c("bmi", "age_cat"),
  approach = "logit"
)
```

## Stepwise Model Selection
```r
model_selection <- select_models(
  data = pima_data,
  outcome = "diabetes",
  exposures = c("bmi", "age_cat"),
  approach = "logit",
  direction = "forward"
)

model_selection$results_table
model_selection$best_model
```

## Interaction Assessment
```r
interaction_models(
  data = pima_data,
  outcome = "diabetes",
  exposure = "bmi",
  covariates = "age_cat",
  effect_modifier = "glucose_cat",
  approach = "logit",
  test = "LRT"
)
```
## Visualizing Results
```r
plot_reg(uni_tbl)

plot_reg(multi_tbl)

plot_reg_combine(
  tbl_uni = uni_tbl,
  tbl_multi = multi_tbl,
  title_uni = "Unadjusted",
  title_multi = "Adjusted"
)
```
## Saving Outputs
```r
save_table(multi_tbl, file = "regression_table.html")   

save_docx(multi_tbl, file = "regression_table.docx")   

save_plot(plot_reg(multi_tbl), file = "regression_plot.png")    

```

## Conclusion

The `gtregression` package simplifies regression coding and produces publication-ready tables with interpretation notes. It enables beginners to explore a variety of regression models with ease, transparency, and reproducibility. Explore the documentation for each function to discover additional options and customization features.
