Description: 
  gtregression enhances the user experience by simplifying complex steps to do regression in R. 
  It wraps widely used modeling and summarization packages (such as gtsummary, risks, MASS, 
  and stats) into a cohesive and user-friendly interface. Designed with LMIC users in mind, 
  it reduces the need for verbose or multi-package code, offering publication-ready tables, 
  automated diagnostics with interpretation, and sensible defaults â€” all aligned with reproducible and evidence-based practices.
